# Day 2 — Embeddings

Today I started learning about embeddings.

## What are Embeddings?
- An embedding is a vector that represents data in a high-dimensional space.
- Words, sentences, or images can all be represented as vectors.
- Embeddings allow AI models to measure similarity and relationships.

## Why It Matters
- Search engines, recommendation systems, and AI chatbots all rely on embeddings.
- Understanding embeddings helps debug and improve AI behavior.

## Key Takeaways
- Embeddings transform raw data into meaningful numbers.
- Distance between embeddings represents similarity.
- Good embeddings capture semantic meaning.
