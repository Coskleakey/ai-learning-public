## Day 4 – NumPy Array Shape & Reshaping

Today I focused on building intuition around **array shape and reshaping** in NumPy.

### Key Concepts Learned

- **Shape** describes how data is structured across dimensions, not just how many dimensions exist.
- `ndim` tells *how many axes* an array has, while `shape` tells *how many elements are in each axis*.
- Reshaping does **not change data**, only how it is interpreted.
- The total number of elements must remain constant when reshaping.

### Example: Reshaping a 1D Array into 2D

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12])
reshaped = arr.reshape(4, 3)

print(reshaped)
print("Shape:", reshaped.shape)
