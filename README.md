# AI Learning Journey — Public Documentation

This repository is my public log of learning AI from first principles.

## Why I’m Doing This

I’m not documenting tutorials or shortcuts.
I’m documenting **my process of understanding AI deeply** — the way it actually works under the hood.

AI mastery requires understanding:
- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Embeddings & vector spaces
- Transformers & attention
- RAG (Retrieve-Augment-Generate) pipelines
- How these systems are implemented on GPUs

I come from a background where my parents sacrificed greatly to educate me.  
I want to honor that sacrifice by building real competence, not performing success.

## How I Will Document

- Daily or weekly notes in `/notes`
- Experiments, failures, and insights
- Mental models and “aha moments”
- References to books, papers, and tutorials

## How to Follow Along

- Check `/notes` regularly for updates
- Contribute with corrections, suggestions, or discussions
- This is a learning community — all feedback is welcome
