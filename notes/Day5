Day 5 – NumPy: Broadcasting, Slicing & Stacking

Topics covered:

1️⃣ Broadcasting

Enables operations between arrays and scalars without loops

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr * 2


Critical for performance in AI workloads

2️⃣ Slicing vs Splitting

Slicing: returns a view (shares memory)

Splitting: returns new arrays

Slicing is commonly used inside models

Splitting is used for dataset preparation and batching

3️⃣ Stacking Arrays

np.vstack() → adds rows (stack samples)

np.hstack() → adds columns (stack features)

a1 = np.array([[1,1],[2,2]])
a2 = np.array([[3,3],[4,4]])

np.vstack((a1, a2))
np.hstack((a1, a2))

4️⃣ Key Takeaway

AI data structures are tensors, not just matrices.
Understanding shape manipulation is foundational for ML and DL systems.
