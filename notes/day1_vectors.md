# Day 1 — Vectors

Today I started learning vectors from first principles.

## What is a Vector?
- A vector is a direction and magnitude in space.
- Example: an arrow on a map.  
- In AI, vectors represent data: words, images, or even concepts.

## Why It Matters
- AI uses vectors to find similarity.
- Embeddings are vectors in high-dimensional space.
- Understanding vectors helps debug AI, design embeddings, and reason about models.

## Key Takeaways
- A vector has direction and length.
- Multiple vectors can form a vector space.
- Distance between vectors represents similarity.
